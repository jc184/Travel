My version of the application featured in Packt Publishing's ASP.NET Core and Vue.js, by Devlin Basilan Duldulao.
It is a .NET Core 5.0 Web API project with a Vue front end and numerous advanced features.

To run this application you will not need to install any database software as it uses an embedded Sqlite3 database.
